# Design Pattern

`Design Patterns` made with `Java` mainly from `Christopher Okhravi`'s Design Pattern videos, with some other important design patterns.

Change: 
1. I think Chris's `State Pattern` example is way too complicated, so I used Mosh's example.

2. Added `Null Object Pattern`.
3. Now adding `Memento Pattern` with `Programming with Mosh`.
